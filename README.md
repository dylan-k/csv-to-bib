# Convert .csv to .bib

I had some bibliographic data collected into a spreadsheet, but I needed to bring it into a citation manger like Zotero or Jabref. Existing tools assume a pre-existing structure for the .csv data, which is often undocumented. This project is an attempt to make it a little easier, at least for me. 

I'm starting from a fork of a straightforward-looking python script, a gist created by @mikeesto. Also, I'm working with the "Article" type of references, so that's my priority right now, though I suppose the script could be extended to support other types, as needed. 

Contributions are welcome.
